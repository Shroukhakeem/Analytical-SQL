a- What is the maximum number of consecutive days a customer made purchases?


SELECT DISTINCT cust_id, MAX(days_count) OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id) AS max_cosecutive_days
FROM (
  SELECT tab2.*, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id, comparing_date) AS days_count
  FROM (
    SELECT tab1.*, calendar_dt - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id ORDER BY calendar_dt) AS comparing_date
    FROM transactions tab1
  ) tab2
) 
ORDER BY cust_id;




b- On average, How many days/transactions does it take a customer to reach a spent threshold of 250 L.E?


SELECT DISTINCT
    cust_id,
    CEIL(AVG(days_count) OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id)) AS days_to_spend_250LE
FROM (
    SELECT
        tab4.*,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id, days_count, twofifties ORDER BY calendar_dt) AS rnk
    FROM (
        SELECT
            tab3.*,
            SUM(AMT_LE) OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id, twofifties ORDER BY calendar_dt, cust_id) AS Result,
            CASE
                WHEN AMT_LE > 250 THEN 1
                ELSE COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id, twofifties)
            END AS days_count
        FROM (
            SELECT
                tab2.*,
                FLOOR(Total_Sum / 250) AS twofifties
            FROM (
                SELECT
                    tab1.*,
                    SUM(AMT_LE) OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id ORDER BY calendar_dt, cust_id) AS Total_Sum
                FROM
                    QUE tab1
            ) tab2
        ) tab3
    ) tab4
)
WHERE
    rnk = 1
ORDER BY
    cust_id;
